# Botium Toys Security Audit
This repository is a security audit exercise for Google's Cybersecurity course on a dummmy company called "Botium Toys"

> I will be trying to develop this repository not only on the NIST-CSF perspective as it's asked on the course but also on Brazilian's laws and regulations perspective using the course as an extension to FIB Youth Program that I am participating this year.

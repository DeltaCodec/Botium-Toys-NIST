# Botium Toys Security Audit
This repository is a security audit exercise for Google's Cybersecurity course on a dummmy company called "Botium Toys"

I will be trying to develop this repository not only on the NIST-CSF perspective that is asked on the course but also on a Brazilian perspective utilizing laws and regulations.

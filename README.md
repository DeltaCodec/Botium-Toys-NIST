## Introduction

This repository is a security audit exercise for [Google's Cybersecurity Course](https://www.coursera.org/google-certificates/cybersecurity-certificate) on a dummy company called "Botium Toys"
> I will try to develop this repository not only on the NIST-CSF perspective as it's asked on the course but also on Brazilian's laws and regulations perspective using the course as an extension to FIB Youth Program that I am participating this year.
## Scenario
Botium Toys is a small U.S. business that develops and sells toys. The business has a single physical location, which serves as their main office, a storefront, and warehouse for their products. However, Botium Toy’s online presence has grown, attracting customers in the U.S. and abroad. As a result, their information technology (IT) department is under increasing pressure to support their online market worldwide. 

The manager of the IT department has decided that an internal IT audit needs to be conducted. She's worried about maintaining compliance and business operations as the company grows without a clear plan. She believes an internal audit can help better secure the company’s infrastructure and help them identify and mitigate potential risks, threats, or vulnerabilities to critical assets. The manager is also interested in ensuring that they comply with regulations related to internally processing and accepting online payments and conducting business in the European Union (E.U.).   

The IT manager starts by implementing the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF), establishing an audit scope and goals, listing assets currently managed by the IT department, and completing a risk assessment. The goal of the audit is to provide an overview of the risks and/or fines that the company might experience due to the current state of their security posture.

> My task is to review the IT manager’s scope, goals, and risk assessment report. Then, perform an internal audit by completing a controls and compliance checklist.

**Scope and goals of the audit**
* **Scope:** The scope is defined as the entire security program at Botium Toys. This means all assets need to be assessed alongside internal processes and procedures related to the implementation of controls and compliance best practices.


* **Goals:** Assess existing assets and complete the controls and compliance checklist to determine which controls and compliance best practices need to be implemented to  improve Botium Toys’ security posture.

### Optimization for Small Businesses
As the company is a small business (SMB), this audit can be optimized using the [NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0: Small Business Quick-Start Guide](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.1300.pdf), a resource provided on NIST's website.

>"This guide provides small-to-medium sized businesses (SMB), specifically those who have modest or no cybersecurity plans
in place, with considerations to kick-start their cybersecurity risk management strategy by using the NIST Cybersecurity
Framework (CSF) 2.0. The guide also can assist other relatively small organizations, such as non-profits, government
agencies, and schools. It is a supplement to the NIST CSF and is not intended to replace it."

The company scored an 8 on the **Risk Score** due the lack of controls and adherence to compliance and best practices, this also qualifies this resource as a useful tool for this audit.
